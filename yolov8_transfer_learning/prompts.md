## Annotation Script for YOLO Format Labels
I have a lot of images that I need to annotate with the yolo format labels in the images directory. Can you implement me the #annotation.py script. Please, use the cv2 library to display the images and capture mouse events. I want the buttons 1 to 9 to be used as a class selector (currently I have only 2 classes - vehicle front and vehicle rear). Then I need the app to implement 2 modes (draw and edit) switched between by pressing the 'e' key. In drawing mode a bounding box for the current class will be drawn by clicking and dragging the mouse. In edit mode, I want to be able to move the closes edge of an existing bounding box by clicking and dragging it. The annotations should be saved automatically once I switch to the next image. Please, use the keys 'a' and 'd' to navigate between the images. Save the images and labels to fronts_rears_dataset directory. Last, I would like to remove wrong bounding boxes by pressing the 'r' key while hovering over them (allow removing the bounding box only when the mouse is inside it). Use an appropriate color palete to distinguish between the classes. Display the currently selected class at the top left corner of the image, the current mode (draw/edit) at the top center and the image index/total number of images at the top right corner. The script should display the annotation window in full screen mode. The 'q' and 'esc' keys should quit the application. Add any other improvements that might be useful for the annotation process and I forgot to specify them.

## Model Evaluation Script
I have trained a yolov8s (yolov8s_front_rears.pt) model for vehicle front and rear detection using a custom dataset. I want to compare it against the original model trained on the COCO dataset (yolov8s_COCO.pt). Please, implement the #evaluate.py script that will display me the images in the images directory with the bounding boxes from both models (0 - vehicle) in my custom model. Use all the vehicle type classes from the COCO dataset (car, motorcycle, bus, truck, train). Use green for the custom model and red for vehicle types from the COCO dataset. Use the cv2 library and display the images in full screen mode. Use the 'a' and 'd' keys to navigate between the images. The 'q' and 'esc' keys should quit the application. Display the image index/total number of images at the top right corner of the image, please. Make all labels large enough to be easily readable, please.
