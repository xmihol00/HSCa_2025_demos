# YOLOv8 Transfer Learning for Vehicle Front and Rear Detection
This example demonstrates how to train (transfer learn) a pre-trained YOLOv8 model to detect the front and rear of vehicles using a custom dataset. The dataset is relatively small, yet the results are quite good due to the effectiveness of transferring the learned features from the pre-trained model.

## Dataset
Download the front and rears dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bECo3HnmnOgeGr8qhRfy83ySEqfi6xKf/view?usp=sharing. Unzip it and change paths in the `training.py` and the `data.yaml` files as needed.
